### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Devanshu, CSE Core first year. I am a graphics & logo designer and a competitive coder. I am familiar with python & C++ , and Currently I'm marking my steps towards web development. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing chess, or designing graphics, or doing nerdy things .
